# surfs_up

##Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
w Avey has concerns on the weather in Oahu and how it will affect our ice cream and surf board business.

##Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.
* Average temperatures are similar in Dec and June (71 and 75 degrees respectively)
* The variation between the months is quite different though, where the minimum for Dec is 56 while June is 64, which makes a large difference when eating ice cream
* The temperatures seem to be similar enough but we'll see higher temps with June and lower with Dec as demonstrated in images titled June and Dec

##Summary: Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.
While overall numbers look fine (average temp, minimum/max, quartiles etc), the concern will exist that there will be potential days/times of months where it will be too cold for surfing and ice ccream. To understand that more, we would have to look deeper into days/weeks of analysis rather than overall month analysis.
An easy start is to first understand what temperature is too cold for either of those (suppose 60 degrees). Bucketing our temperature data in buckets (below and above 60) will help us understand how often our business will be operable as well as when it wil lbe very busy/popular etc.
